## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Hi, Iâ€™m Jayanth P.**  
Iâ€™m a junior at [IIIT Kottayam](https://iiitkottayam.ac.in/#!/home) pursuing Computer Science. I recently ventured into web development, and Iâ€™m absolutely loving the journey. Even getting a small to-do app up and running excites me, and Iâ€™m fascinated by how many great resources are available online to help me when i get stuck.

Design has become one of my favorite parts of front-end developmentâ€”whether itâ€™s creating eye-catching components or admiring the work of other talented developers. In my free time, I am scrolling reddit or admiring some random figma file or trying to find the inspiration for new designs.
