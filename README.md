I’m Jayanth , a junior at [IIIT Kottayam](https://iiitkottayam.ac.in/#!/home) pursuing Computer Science. I code when i dont have anything interesting to do, I love to solve dsa questions and learn new things in nextjs. I love design and i hope to be able to build websites that makes the creative person in me happy. You can always catch me watching F1 edits or race highlights when i dont feel like coding. If i dont wanna be indoors, gym is the next best place to be or else an indoor sports stadium playing badminton or trying out other sports.
